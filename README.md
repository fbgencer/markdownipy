# Markdownipy

![](markdownipy_logo.png)

Markdownipy is a Python library to generate markdown files using only two operators and some helpers

##  `<` writes text to markdown file, `|` just gives property to the text

Even this README file is genereted by markdownipy!

[Checkout example file](./example.py)

## Motivation

---


Lately, I'm trying to write markdown documentations for different codes and I needed to put
some specs, numbers etc. so just copy-paste some tables, links.
I was trying to change some predefined strings to speed up my writing process, yet
instead of text manipulation I just wanted to make it as a library.

Sometimes I also forget markdown syntax, so this library requires no memory (I hope so, there is even no function calls) :)

Only requirement is remember properties of markdown and the rest will be handled

### Install

`pip install markdownipy`

---

### Quick start

```python
from markdownipy import markdownipy
md = markdownipy.markdownipy()

#Simple line
md < "Hello there!"

#Bold text, numbers are also allowed
md < 3.14159 | md.bold

#Italic text
md < "Above bold text is just some digits of pi" | md.italic

#One line code and codeblock

md < "One line code " | md.code
md < '''
void markdownipy_helper(int x, int y, int z):
	return x*y*z
''' | md.codeb("cpp")


#Lists 
md < ["Item1","Item2","Item3"]

#Tables
md < {
	"Country":["Fran","Kate","Ivan"],
	"Age" : [30,48,73]
}

#E-mail, links
md < "fbgencer8@gmail.com" | md.link
md < "fbgencer8@gmail.com" | md.link("My mail")

#Image
md < "markdownipy_logo.png" | md.image

#Writing to a file, README or README.md both works!
md >> "README"
```
