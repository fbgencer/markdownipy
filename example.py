md < """
Lately, I'm trying to write markdown documentations for different codes and I needed to put
some specs, numbers etc. so just copy-paste some tables, links.
I was trying to change some predefined strings to speed up my writing process, yet
instead of text manipulation I just wanted to make it as a library.

Sometimes I also forget markdown syntax, so this library requires no memory (I hope so) :)
Only requirement is remember properties of markdown and the rest will be handled
